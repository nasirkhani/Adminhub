## **What is Unicast VRRP?**

**Standard VRRP (Multicast)**:
- Nodes broadcast advertisements to multicast address 224.0.0.18
- All VRRP routers on the network segment receive these broadcasts
- Automatic peer discovery - nodes don't need to know each other's IPs

**Unicast VRRP**:
- Nodes send advertisements directly to specific peer IP addresses
- Point-to-point communication between explicitly configured peers
- Manual peer configuration required - you specify which IPs to communicate with

## **Limitations and Effects**

**Functional Limitations**:
- **Scaling constraint**: Adding new VRRP nodes requires updating all existing configurations
- **Static configuration**: Can't auto-discover new peers like multicast can
- **Network overhead**: Slightly higher CPU usage due to multiple unicast packets vs single multicast

**Practical Reality for Your Setup**:
- **No functional impact**: Your 2-node HA setup works identically to multicast
- **No performance impact**: Negligible difference for small deployments
- **Better reliability**: Actually more reliable in virtualized environments
- **Enterprise standard**: Many production environments prefer unicast VRRP

The unicast VRRP solution is actually a more robust approach for enterprise environments and won't cause future problems. Many organizations prefer it over multicast due to better control and fewer network dependencies.
