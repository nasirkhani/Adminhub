\# **Building a High-Availability Airflow Cluster**\
*To deploy Airflow in a high-availability setup, use redundant components:*
1) a replicated metadata database (e.g., PostgreSQL), multiple schedulers with load balancing, and distributed Celery workers with a reliable message broker (e.g., Redis).
2) Containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) improve fault tolerance, while shared storage ensures consistent DAGs and logs.
3) Monitoring and automated backups complete the resilient architecture.
