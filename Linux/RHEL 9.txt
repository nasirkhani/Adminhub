RHEL installer is Anaconda.


Installation Log Files:
/root/anaconda-ks.cfg 	Records the configuration entered
/var/log/anaconda/anaconda.log 	Contains informational, debug, and other general messages
/var/log/anaconda/journal.log 	Stores messages generated by many services and components during system installation
/var/log/anaconda/packaging.log 	Records messages generated by the dnf and rpm commands during software installation
/var/log/anaconda/program.log 	Captures messages generated by external programs
/var/log/anaconda/storage.log 	Records messages generated by storage modules
/var/log/anaconda/syslog 	Records messages related to the kernel
/var/log/anaconda/X.log 	Stores X Window System information

Files in the /var/log/anaconda directory are actually created and resided in the /tmp directory during the installation;
however, they are moved over once the installation is complete.

During the installation, there are six text-based virtual console screens:

	Console 1 (Ctrl+Alt+F1): This is the main screen. Before Anaconda begins, you will select a 
			language to use during installation, and then it will switch the default console to the sixth screen (Console 6).
	Console 2 (Ctrl+Alt+F2): Presents the shell interface to run commands as the root user.
	Console 3 (Ctrl+Alt+F3): Displays installation messages and stores them in /tmp/anaconda.log file. 
			This file also captures information on detected hardware, in addition to other data.
	Console 4 (Ctrl+Alt+F4): Shows storage messages and records them in /tmp/storage.log file.
	Console 5 (Ctrl+Alt+F5): Exhibits program messages and logs them to /tmp/program.log file.
	Console 6 (Ctrl+Alt+F6): Default graphical configuration and installation console screen.
	
GNOME stands for GNU Network Object Model Environment.

/boot cannot reside within LVM.

Wayland is a client/server display protocol. There are two components that are critical
to the functionality of a graphical environment: a display manager (a.k.a. login manager)
and a desktop environment. Both are launched following the completion of the groundwork
established by Wayland.

Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) for file organization, which describes names, locations, and permissions for many file types
and directories.

Static data refers to file content that remains unchanged unless modified explicitly. 
Dynamic or variable data, in contrast, refers to file content that is modified and updated as required by system processes.

Static directories normally contain commands, configuration files, library routines, kernel files, device files, etc.
dynamic directories contain log files, status files, temporary files, etc.

File System Categories:
	disk-based: Disk-based file systems are typically created on physical media such as a hard drive or a USB flash drive
	network-based: file systems are essentially disk-based file systems that are shared over the network for remote access.
	memory-based: file systems are virtual; they are created automatically at system startup and destroyed when the system goes down. 

/etc: The etcetera (or extended text configuration)
UNIX System Resources Directory (/usr) This directory contains most of the system files.
/usr/bin: The binary directory contains crucial user executable commands.
/usr/sbin: Most commands are required at system boot, this directory contains crucial system administration commands that are not
intended for execution by normal users
The Devices File System (/dev), Virtual
These device nodes are automatically created and deleted by the udevd service (a Linux service for 
dynamic device management) as necessary.

/proc kernel state, virtual
/run running process, virtual
/sys Information about hardware devices, drivers, and some kernel features is stored and maintained in the /sys file system.
This information is used by the kernel to load necessary support for the devices, create device nodes in /dev, 
and configure the devices.
