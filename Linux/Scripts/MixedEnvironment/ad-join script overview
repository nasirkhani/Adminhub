This script automates joining a Linux system to an Active Directory domain, handling DNS, time sync, package installation, and configuration of authentication components.

Key Components:
1) Privilege Check
  Ensures script runs as root (required for system-wide changes)
2) DNS Validation
  Verifies proper SRV record resolution for AD domain controllers
  Critical for discovering AD services
3) Time Synchronization
  Checks/installs NTP service (Chrony)
  Compares local time with AD domain time (max 5 min difference allowed)
4) Package Installation
  Installs required AD integration tools:
    realmd, sssd, adcli, Kerberos, Samba
  Handles both apt/yum package managers
5) Domain Join Process
  Uses Kerberos authentication (kinit) with AD admin credentials
  Executes realm join for actual domain enrollment
6) SSSD Configuration
  Configures user-friendly logins (no FQDN)
  Sets home directory template
  Secures configuration file permissions (600)
7) PAM Setup
  Enables automatic home directory creation
  Essential for first-time user logins
8) Sudo Integration
  Allows AD group sudo access via dedicated sudoers file
  Ensures secure file permissions (440)
9) Verification Checks
  Validates domain membership
  Tests user lookup
  Verifies SSSD service status
