The noexec mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain executable binaries.

Since the /tmp filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to ensure that users cannot run executable binaries from /tmp .

Edit the /etc/fstab file and add noexec to the fourth field (mounting options) for the /tmp partition.

Example:

<device> /tmp <fstype> defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0.
Run the following command to remount /tmp with the configured options:

# mount -o remount /tmp
