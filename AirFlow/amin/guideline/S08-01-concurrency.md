```
airflow command error: unrecognized arguments: --hostname remote_worker_1
```

In Airflow 2.9, the `--hostname` argument has been removed or changed. Let's fix this:

## Fix the systemd service

```bash
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/airflow-remote-worker-1.service
```

Remove the `--hostname` argument:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Airflow Remote Worker 1 (Generic)
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=rocky
Group=rocky
Environment=AIRFLOW_HOME=/home/rocky/airflow
Environment=PATH=/home/rocky/.local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
Environment=PYTHONPATH=/home/rocky/airflow:/home/rocky/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages
WorkingDirectory=/home/rocky/airflow
ExecStart=/home/rocky/.local/bin/airflow celery worker --queues remote_tasks,default --concurrency 3
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10s
SyslogIdentifier=airflow-remote-worker-1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

The key change is removing `--hostname remote_worker_1` from the ExecStart line.

## Reload and restart

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart airflow-remote-worker-1
sudo systemctl status airflow-remote-worker-1
```

## If you want to set a custom hostname (optional)

In Airflow 2.9, the hostname is typically auto-generated. If you need a custom hostname, you can set it via environment variable:

```ini
Environment=AIRFLOW__CELERY__WORKER_HOSTNAME=remote_worker_1
```

But this is usually not necessary - the default hostname (based on the machine name and process ID) works fine.

## Check available options

To see what arguments are actually available for the celery worker in your version:

```bash
/home/rocky/.local/bin/airflow celery worker --help
```

This will show you all valid options for your specific Airflow version.

Try the updated service file without the `--hostname` argument and let me know if it starts successfully!

## Understanding Concurrency

### **Concurrency vs Task Dependencies**

You're right that tasks in a DAG run serially when they have dependencies:
```
Task1 >> Task2 >> Task3  # Serial execution
```

But **concurrency** means:
1. **Multiple DAGs** can run simultaneously
2. **Independent tasks** within a DAG can run in parallel
3. **Different DAGs' tasks** can run at the same time

### **Simple Example Scenario**

```python
# This DAG shows concurrency in action
@dag(schedule_interval='@hourly', max_active_runs=3)
def concurrency_demo():
    
    @task
    def start_task():
        return "Starting"
    
    # These 3 tasks have NO dependencies on each other
    @task
    def process_vm1():
        time.sleep(30)  # Simulate 30 second job
        return "VM1 done"
    
    @task  
    def process_vm2():
        time.sleep(30)  # Simulate 30 second job
        return "VM2 done"
    
    @task
    def process_vm3():
        time.sleep(30)  # Simulate 30 second job
        return "VM3 done"
    
    @task
    def combine_results(r1, r2, r3):
        return f"Combined: {r1}, {r2}, {r3}"
    
    # Parallel execution pattern
    start = start_task()
    
    # These run IN PARALLEL (concurrency=3 means all 3 can run at once)
    result1 = process_vm1()
    result2 = process_vm2()  
    result3 = process_vm3()
    
    # Fan-in pattern
    start >> [result1, result2, result3]
    combine_results(result1, result2, result3)
```

With `concurrency=3`, all three `process_vm*` tasks run **simultaneously**, taking 30 seconds total instead of 90 seconds serial.

## Determining Proper Concurrency

### **Key Metrics to Consider**

1. **CPU Cores**: General rule = 2-4 workers per core
2. **Memory**: Each worker needs ~100-500MB
3. **Task Type**:
   - CPU-intensive: 1-2 per core
   - I/O-intensive (like SSH): 4-8 per core
   - API calls: Can go higher (10-20 per core)

### **Formula for Your SSH Tasks**
```
Concurrency = (CPU Cores Ã— 4) - 1
Example: 4 cores = 15 concurrent tasks
```

### **Resource Usage per Task**
- **Memory**: ~50-200MB per task
- **CPU**: Minimal for SSH tasks (mostly waiting)
- **Network**: 1 SSH connection per task

---

## Production Worker Strategies

### **Common Patterns**

1. **By Task Type** (Recommended):
```python
# Heavy processing queue
airflow celery worker --queues cpu_intensive --concurrency 2

# Light I/O tasks  
airflow celery worker --queues io_tasks --concurrency 10

# Default queue
airflow celery worker --queues default --concurrency 5
```

2. **By Priority**:
```python
# High priority
airflow celery worker --queues high_priority --concurrency 8

# Normal priority
airflow celery worker --queues default --concurrency 4
```

3. **NOT by VM** (Anti-pattern):
```python
# DON'T DO THIS for 100 VMs:
# airflow celery worker --queues vm1_queue
# airflow celery worker --queues vm2_queue  
# ... 100 workers!
```

## Concurrency Demonstration Code

Create this DAG to visualize concurrency:

```python
# concurrent_demo_dag.py
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from airflow.decorators import dag, task
import time
import random

@dag(
    dag_id='concurrency_visual_demo',
    schedule_interval=None,
    start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    catchup=False,
    max_active_tasks=10,  # DAG-level concurrency limit
    default_args={'owner': 'rocky'}
)
def concurrency_demo():
    
    @task(queue='high_priority')
    def simulate_quick_task(task_num):
        """Simulates a quick task (5-10 seconds)"""
        start = datetime.now()
        duration = random.randint(5, 10)
        time.sleep(duration)
        end = datetime.now()
        
        return {
            'task': f'quick_{task_num}',
            'start': start.isoformat(),
            'end': end.isoformat(),
            'duration': duration,
            'queue': 'high_priority'
        }
    
    @task(queue='default')
    def simulate_slow_task(task_num):
        """Simulates a slow task (20-30 seconds)"""
        start = datetime.now()
        duration = random.randint(20, 30)
        time.sleep(duration)
        end = datetime.now()
        
        return {
            'task': f'slow_{task_num}',
            'start': start.isoformat(),
            'end': end.isoformat(),
            'duration': duration,
            'queue': 'default'
        }
    
    @task
    def analyze_concurrency(results):
        """Shows how tasks ran concurrently"""
        print("\n=== CONCURRENCY ANALYSIS ===")
        print(f"Total tasks: {len(results)}")
        
        # Sort by start time
        sorted_results = sorted(results, key=lambda x: x['start'])
        
        # Find overlapping tasks
        overlaps = 0
        for i in range(len(sorted_results)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(sorted_results)):
                task1_end = sorted_results[i]['end']
                task2_start = sorted_results[j]['start']
                if task2_start < task1_end:
                    overlaps += 1
                    print(f"CONCURRENT: {sorted_results[i]['task']} and {sorted_results[j]['task']}")
        
        print(f"\nTotal concurrent executions: {overlaps}")
        
        # Timeline visualization
        print("\n=== EXECUTION TIMELINE ===")
        for r in sorted_results:
            print(f"{r['task']:12} [{r['start'][11:19]}] --> [{r['end'][11:19]}] ({r['duration']}s) Queue: {r['queue']}")
        
        return "Analysis complete"
    
    # Create 5 quick tasks and 3 slow tasks
    quick_results = []
    slow_results = []
    
    for i in range(5):
        quick_results.append(simulate_quick_task(i))
    
    for i in range(3):
        slow_results.append(simulate_slow_task(i))
    
    # All tasks will start at once (up to concurrency limit)
    all_results = quick_results + slow_results
    
    # Analyze how they ran
    analyze_concurrency(all_results)

dag = concurrency_demo()
```

### **Monitor Queues in Real-Time**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Watch RabbitMQ queues
watch -n 1 'sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages consumers'

# Terminal 2: Monitor active tasks
watch -n 1 'airflow celery inspect active'

# Terminal 3: See worker status
airflow celery inspect stats

# Terminal 4: Flower UI (visual queue monitoring)
# Browse to: http://192.168.83.129:5555
```

### **Test Different Concurrency Settings**

```bash
# Stop current worker
sudo systemctl stop airflow-remote-worker-1

# Test with different concurrency
airflow celery worker --queues default --concurrency 1   # Serial
airflow celery worker --queues default --concurrency 5   # Parallel
airflow celery worker --queues default --concurrency 10  # More parallel
```

Run the demo DAG with each setting and observe:
- With concurrency=1: Tasks run one at a time
- With concurrency=5: Up to 5 tasks run simultaneously
- Execution time drops dramatically with higher concurrency

This demonstrates that concurrency is about **parallel task execution across DAGs and within DAGs for independent tasks**, not about task dependencies within a single workflow path.
