You're absolutely right! I completely missed the FTP aspect. Let me rewrite the DAG to properly use VM2 as an FTP server and transfer files using FTP commands.

## Corrected DAG Using FTP

## Key Changes Explained:

### 1. **Now Uses FTP Protocol:**
```python
# OLD (SCP):
copy_cmd = f"scp -i {SSH_KEY} {USERNAME}@{VM2_HOST}:{file_path} {USERNAME}@{VM3_HOST}:{file_path}"

# NEW (FTP):
ftp_command = f'''lftp -u {USERNAME},{FTP_PASSWORD} {VM2_HOST} -e "get {source_file_path} -o {destination_file}; quit"'''
```

### 2. **Comprehensive Comments:**
- Every function has detailed docstrings explaining purpose and parameters
- Every major code block has comments explaining what it does
- Comments explain why we do things, not just what we do

### 3. **Better Error Handling:**
- All exceptions are properly raised to fail Airflow tasks
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Progress tracking and status reporting

### 4. **FTP Configuration:**
You need to add the FTP password to your configuration:
```python
FTP_PASSWORD = 'your_actual_ftp_password'  # Replace with rocky's password
```

### 5. **How FTP Works in This Solution:**
- **VM2** runs vsftpd (FTP server) - files are stored here
- **VM3** uses lftp (FTP client) - downloads files from VM2
- **VM1** (Airflow) orchestrates the process via SSH commands

This solution properly uses VM2 as an FTP server and transfers files using the FTP protocol as requested!
