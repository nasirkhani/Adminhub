# Worker Slots Explained - Simple Scenario

## What are Worker Slots?

**Worker slots = Maximum number of tasks that can run at the same time**

Think of worker slots like **parking spaces** in a parking lot:
- You have **limited parking spaces** (worker slots)
- Each **car** (task) needs **one parking space**
- When parking is **full**, new cars must **wait**

## Simple Example

**Imagine you have 3 worker slots (3 parking spaces):**

### Scenario: Poke Mode Problem

```python
# You have 3 worker slots total

# Task 1: Sensor in POKE mode - waits for file
@task.sensor(mode='poke', poke_interval=60, timeout=3600)  # Waits 1 hour
def wait_for_file_A():
    return PokeReturnValue(is_done=False)  # Still waiting...

# Task 2: Sensor in POKE mode - waits for file  
@task.sensor(mode='poke', poke_interval=60, timeout=3600)  # Waits 1 hour
def wait_for_file_B():
    return PokeReturnValue(is_done=False)  # Still waiting...

# Task 3: Sensor in POKE mode - waits for file
@task.sensor(mode='poke', poke_interval=60, timeout=3600)  # Waits 1 hour  
def wait_for_file_C():
    return PokeReturnValue(is_done=False)  # Still waiting...

# Task 4: Important processing task
@task
def process_urgent_data():
    return "This needs to run NOW!"
```

**What happens:**
```
Worker Slot 1: [OCCUPIED] - wait_for_file_A (checking every 60 seconds)
Worker Slot 2: [OCCUPIED] - wait_for_file_B (checking every 60 seconds) 
Worker Slot 3: [OCCUPIED] - wait_for_file_C (checking every 60 seconds)

🚫 process_urgent_data() = WAITING IN QUEUE (no free slots!)
```

**Result:** Your urgent task can't run because all workers are busy waiting!

## The Problem Visualized

**Timeline with Poke Mode:**
```
Time: 0:00    [Slot1: SensorA] [Slot2: SensorB] [Slot3: SensorC]
Time: 1:00    [Slot1: SensorA] [Slot2: SensorB] [Slot3: SensorC]  ← Still waiting
Time: 2:00    [Slot1: SensorA] [Slot2: SensorB] [Slot3: SensorC]  ← Still waiting
Time: 3:00    [Slot1: SensorA] [Slot2: SensorB] [Slot3: SensorC]  ← Still waiting

🚫 UrgentTask: WAITING... WAITING... WAITING...
```
# When to Use Poke Mode

**Use Poke Mode when you need IMMEDIATE response and expect SHORT waits:**

**1. Quick file arrivals (under 5-10 minutes):** If you expect the file to arrive soon and need to process it immediately when it does. **Example:** Real-time trading data that arrives every few minutes and must be processed instantly.

**2. You have plenty of worker slots:** If you have many available workers and blocking one isn't a problem. **Example:** Large Airflow cluster with 50+ worker slots where using 3-4 for sensors doesn't matter.

**3. Critical, time-sensitive processes:** When even a few minutes delay from rescheduling could cause business problems. **Example:** Fraud detection system that needs to process alerts within seconds of file arrival.

**Rule of thumb:** Use **Poke Mode** for waits under 5 minutes when immediate response is critical. Use **Reschedule Mode** for waits over 5 minutes or when worker slots are limited. Most production systems prefer Reschedule Mode because worker resources are usually more valuable than a few minutes delay.  


## Solution: Reschedule Mode

**Change to reschedule mode:**
```python
@task.sensor(mode='reschedule', poke_interval=300)  # Check every 5 minutes
def wait_for_file_A():
    return PokeReturnValue(is_done=False)
```

**Timeline with Reschedule Mode:**
```
Time: 0:00    [Slot1: SensorA] [Slot2: SensorB] [Slot3: SensorC]
Time: 0:01    [Slot1: FREE]    [Slot2: FREE]    [Slot3: FREE]     ← Sensors release slots
Time: 0:02    [Slot1: UrgentTask] [Slot2: FREE] [Slot3: FREE]     ← Urgent task runs!
Time: 5:00    [Slot1: SensorA] [Slot2: FREE]    [Slot3: FREE]     ← Sensor checks again
Time: 5:01    [Slot1: FREE]    [Slot2: FREE]    [Slot3: FREE]     ← Releases slot again
```

## Real-World Impact

### Bad Scenario (Poke Mode)
```python
# DON'T DO THIS - blocks workers
@dag(start_date=datetime(2025, 1, 1), schedule_interval='@hourly')
def bad_example():
    
    @task.sensor(mode='poke', poke_interval=30, timeout=7200)  # 2 hours!
    def wait_file1(): 
        return PokeReturnValue(is_done=False)
    
    @task.sensor(mode='poke', poke_interval=30, timeout=7200)  # 2 hours!
    def wait_file2(): 
        return PokeReturnValue(is_done=False)
    
    @task
    def important_backup():
        return "This backup should run every hour!"
    
    # If files don't arrive, workers are blocked for 2 hours!
    wait_file1()
    wait_file2() 
    important_backup()  # This might never run!
```

### Good Scenario (Reschedule Mode)
```python
# DO THIS - frees up workers
@dag(start_date=datetime(2025, 1, 1), schedule_interval='@hourly')
def good_example():
    
    @task.sensor(mode='reschedule', poke_interval=600, timeout=7200)  # Check every 10 min
    def wait_file1(): 
        return PokeReturnValue(is_done=False)
    
    @task.sensor(mode='reschedule', poke_interval=600, timeout=7200)  # Check every 10 min
    def wait_file2(): 
        return PokeReturnValue(is_done=False)
    
    @task
    def important_backup():
        return "This backup runs on schedule!"
    
    # Workers are free between sensor checks
    wait_file1()
    wait_file2() 
    important_backup()  # This can run immediately!
```

## Check Your Worker Slots

**See how many worker slots you have:**
```bash
# Check Airflow configuration
airflow config get-value celery worker_concurrency
```

**Typical values:**
- Small setup: 4-8 worker slots
- Medium setup: 16-32 worker slots  
- Large setup: 64+ worker slots

## Key Takeaway

**Poke Mode:**
- ✅ **Pro:** Immediate response when condition is met
- ❌ **Con:** Blocks worker slots while waiting (like a person sitting in a chair doing nothing)

**Reschedule Mode:**
- ✅ **Pro:** Frees up worker slots between checks (person leaves chair, comes back later)
- ❌ **Con:** Slight delay in detection (up to `poke_interval` seconds)

**Rule of thumb:** Use `reschedule` mode for waits longer than 5 minutes!


==========================================================================================

Sure! Here's a concise summary of the last response:

---

### ✅ **Your Hardware**

* **8 CPU cores**, **16 GB RAM**, **SSD**

### 🧮 **Max Worker Concurrency (Concurrent Tasks)**

* Based on: `min(32, 12 * CPU, 8 * RAM)`
* → `min(32, 96, 128)` = **32**
* ✅ **Safe setting:** `worker_concurrency = 32`

### 👷 **Workers per Machine**

* ✅ Recommended: **1 worker per machine**
* Technically possible to run more, but 1 is simpler and safer.

---

### 📌 **Scenario: Run 200 Tasks in Parallel**

* Your machine can run **32 tasks at a time**
* Remaining **168 tasks will queue**
* Tasks will run in \~7 waves

---

### 🛠️ **Options to Manage This**

1. **Let Airflow queue the tasks (default)**
2. Use an **Airflow Pool** to limit concurrency
3. Set **`max_active_tasks`** or **`max_active_tis_per_dag`**
4. **Scale horizontally** with more workers on other machines

---

### ✅ **Final Tip**

If tasks are lightweight or wait on external systems:

* Use **reschedule** or **deferrable** sensors to free up slots

### 📌 Summary

| What You Do                 | What You Get | Notes                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Run the command once        | One worker   | Can listen to 1+ queues                       |
| Run the command twice       | Two workers  | Each can have different queue and concurrency |
| One worker, multiple queues | ✅ Allowed    | Just pass comma-separated queue names         |
| Multiple workers on one VM  | ✅ Allowed    | But must share CPU/memory — be careful        |

---

### ✅ Best Practice on One VM

If you're on a single machine (e.g., 8 CPUs, 16 GB RAM):

* You can **run multiple workers**, each with a lower `--concurrency`
* Or you can **run 1 worker** that listens to **multiple queues** with higher concurrency

> 📌 General recommendation: **Use one worker per VM** unless you really need queue separation for load control or task isolation.
