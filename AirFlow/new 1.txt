Here’s an on-premises Apache Airflow implementation plan tailored for batch processing and process automation, excluding cloud dependencies and CI/CD pipelines:

1. Use Case Focus
Batch Processing:

Scheduled ETL jobs (e.g., nightly CSV/JSON processing, database aggregation).

File ingestion, validation, and archival.

Data transformation workflows (e.g., Parquet conversion, data cleansing).

Process Automation:

Script orchestration (Python, Bash, SQL).

Automated report generation and distribution.

Retry logic for failed tasks (e.g., file processing retries).

2. Infrastructure Requirements
Hardware Specifications
Component	Requirements (On-Premises)
Scheduler	4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM (dedicated server).
Web Server	2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM (hosts Airflow UI).
Workers	- Batch Workers: 8–16 vCPUs, 32GB RAM each (CPU-heavy tasks).
- Light Workers: 4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM (for lightweight automation).
- Scale to 5–10 worker nodes based on workload.
Metadata Database	PostgreSQL (HA cluster):
- Primary: 8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, 200GB SSD.
- Replica: 8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM (for failover).
Message Broker	Redis (4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM) or RabbitMQ cluster (for CeleryExecutor).
Shared Storage	Network-Attached Storage (NAS) or distributed file system (e.g., GlusterFS) for:
- DAG synchronization.
- Log storage (retain 90+ days).
- Batch input/output data.
Software Stack
Executor: CeleryExecutor (simpler setup) or LocalExecutor (small-scale batches).

Dependency Management:

Virtual environments (e.g., venv, pipenv) for Python tasks.

Docker (optional) for isolating batch jobs.

Networking:

Internal VPN for Airflow component communication.

Firewall rules to restrict access to the Airflow UI and database.

3. Deployment Architecture
On-Premises Setup:

Airflow Scheduler/Web Server: Deploy on dedicated servers.

Workers: Deploy on separate physical/virtual machines (VMs).

PostgreSQL Cluster: Use streaming replication for HA.

Redis/RabbitMQ: Deploy on a dedicated server with backups.

Shared Storage: Use NAS for syncing DAGs and storing logs/outputs.

4. Security
Authentication:

Enable Airflow RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

Integrate with LDAP/Active Directory for user management.

Network Security:

Isolate Airflow components in a private network.

Restrict Airflow UI access via VPN or IP whitelisting.

Data Security:

Encrypt sensitive variables using Airflow’s Fernet Key.

Use filesystem encryption for shared storage (NAS).

Secrets Management:

Store credentials in environment variables or a dedicated secrets file (restricted permissions).

5. DAG Design Best Practices
Idempotent Tasks: Ensure tasks can rerun safely (e.g., use timestamps in output paths).

Batch Optimization:

Parallelize tasks using CeleryExecutor with multiple workers.

Use max_active_runs to control resource consumption.

Example DAG:

python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def process_batch(**kwargs):
    # Custom batch logic (e.g., process files from NAS)
    pass

with DAG(
    "nightly_batch",
    schedule_interval="0 3 * * *",
    start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1)
) as dag:
    task1 = PythonOperator(
        task_id="process_data",
        python_callable=process_batch,
        retries=3
    )
6. Monitoring & Logging
Metrics:

Use Prometheus + Grafana to track:

Scheduler health (task queue length, DAG parsing time).

Worker resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O).

Task success/failure rates.

Logging:

Centralize logs in Elasticsearch + Kibana (ELK Stack).

Store task logs on NAS with rotation policies.

Alerting:

Use Alertmanager (with Prometheus) to trigger emails/Slack for:

Task failures exceeding thresholds.

Scheduler unavailability.

7. High Availability (HA)
Scheduler HA: Deploy 2+ schedulers (Airflow 2.0+).

Database HA: PostgreSQL streaming replication with automatic failover.

Worker Scalability: Add/remove worker nodes manually or use static pools.

Shared Storage HA: Configure NAS with RAID or distributed file system replication.

8. Backup & Disaster Recovery
Metadata Database:

Daily pg_dump backups stored on NAS.

Test restoration quarterly.

DAGs:

Version control in Git (e.g., GitLab on-premises).

Sync to NAS for redundancy.

Logs/Outputs:

Retain logs on NAS for 90 days; archive older logs to tape/offline storage.

Recovery Plan:

Restore PostgreSQL from backup.

Redeploy DAGs from Git.

Relaunch Airflow components.

9. Testing & Validation
Staging Environment:

Replicate production hardware to test DAGs and scalability.

Data Integrity Checks:

Add validation tasks to DAGs (e.g., checksum verification for processed files).

Load Testing:

Simulate 100+ concurrent tasks to validate worker capacity.

10. Deployment Process
Manual DAG Deployment:

Copy DAGs to the shared NAS directory (synced across workers).

Use airflow dags list to confirm deployment.

Dependency Management:

Install Python dependencies on workers using requirements.txt.

Use virtual environments to avoid conflicts.

11. Maintenance
Updates:

Schedule Airflow upgrades during maintenance windows.

Test upgrades in staging first.

Housekeeping:

Clean old logs/task metadata from the database (use Airflow’s cleanup DAGs).

Monitor NAS storage usage.

12. On-Premises Tools Stack
Category	Tools
Database	PostgreSQL (HA), pgBackRest for backups
Broker	Redis, RabbitMQ
Storage	NAS (Synology, TrueNAS), GlusterFS
Monitoring	Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
Networking	OpenVPN, pfSense firewall
Cost Considerations
Hardware: ~
10
k
–
10k–20k upfront (servers, NAS, networking).

Maintenance: IT team for hardware/database management.

Go-Live Checklist
Validate DAGs in staging.

Configure firewall rules and VPN access.

Test backups and failover procedures.

Train team on Airflow UI and CLI.

Document SOPs for common issues (e.g., worker failures).

This plan prioritizes reliability, manual control, and cost efficiency for on-premises batch processing. Start with a pilot workflow, refine based on metrics, and scale workers as needed!

in Infrastructure Requirements , why you separate components ? can we install all of this on a baremetal server?
