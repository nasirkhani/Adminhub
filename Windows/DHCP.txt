Step 1: DHCP Discover (IP lease request)

Client broadcast to the network for finding DHCP server
DHCPDISCOVER is a broacast message
Broadcast source address is 0.0.0.0
Broadcast destination address is 255.255.255.255
Client MAC address is in the message
After 4 unsuccessful tries = client set APIPA (169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254)
First attempt 2s // Second attempt 4s // Third attempt 6s // Fourth attempt 16s
ŸçEvery 5 minutes the process will be repeated.
This process will be continued until the DHCP is available.
*******************************************************************************************
Step 2: DHCP Offer (IP Offer Response)

DHCPOFFER is a broadcast message (Part of IP conflict detection)
The client will respond to the first DHCP server response that is receives
	DHCPOFFER message includes:
		Offered IP Address
		Server and Client MAC
		Lease Duration Time
		DHCP Server IP + Subnet
*******************************************************************************************
Step 3: DHCP Request (IP Selection Request)

The Client has not approved the IP, so it will broadcast the reply to all DHCP servers
DHCP broadcasts are sent using User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port numbers 67 and 68
*******************************************************************************************
Step 4: DHCP Acknowledgement (IP Lease Acknowledgement)

DHCP server sent DHCPACK to client

Sometimes the DHCP server will respond with DHCPNACK:
	IP address is not valid
	scope has been deactivated
