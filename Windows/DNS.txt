Root Level Domain (Dot)
Top Level Domain (TLD) --> com, net, edu, co, ...
Second Level Domain (sub Domain) --> microsoft, google, yahoo, ...
Third Level Domain (sub domain) --> hosting, job, mail, ...
The hostname(FQDN) --> srv1, www, mail, srv2, ... Ex: srv1.hosting.google.com.

How DNS Works?

	www.nasirkhani.net.
		DNS Client
		1. Check DNS cache
		2. Check Hosts file
		3. Send request to DNS
		DNS Server
		1. Check DNS zone
		2. Check DNS server cache
		3. Check Hosts file
		4. Check conditional forwarder
		5. Check forwarders
		6. Ask the Root Hints
		DNS client ---> Internal DNS ---> Root Hints ---> Internal DNS -> .net. (TLD DNS Server) -> Internal DNS -> nasirkhani.net. (Second Level DNS Server) => A records (www.nasirkhani.net = 1.1.1.1) -> Internal DNS -> Client DNS (8 Steps)

DNS Deligation: DNS delegation is the process by which a parent DNS zone indicates to DNS resolvers that it has delegated the authority for a DNS subzone (or child zone) to a different set of DNS servers. This allows the DNS resolvers to locate and query the delegated DNS servers for the subzone's DNS records.

DNS query:
	1. Iterative
		8 Steps 
	2. Recursive

DNS Record type:
	A and AAAA -> Convert name to IP
	PTR -> IP to name
	CNAME -> Alias -> convert dns name to anoder dns name
	MX -> Mail Exchanger -> route messages to mail server or indocate the authoritative DNS server for delegated subdomain
	NS -> Name Server -> Provide list of authoritative servers for a domain or indocates the authoritative DNS server for delegated subdomain
	SOA -> Start of authority -> Stores zone property information and determines the primary server for a DNS zone.
	SRV -> Service Locator -> Provides the ability to locate particular service. active direcory uses this record type to locate domain controlers, global catalog servers, and LDAP servers.
	TXT -> Text Record -> Text records area type of domain name system (DNS) record in text format, which contain information about your domain.
	
DNS Zones:
	1. Forward Lookup Zone
	2. Reverse Locator Zone
	3. Primary Zone
		Holds the master copy of the zone database and is replicated to secondary zones. All changes to the zone are made to the primary zone.
	4. Secondary Zone
		A read-only copy of the zone database used to provide fault tolerance and faster name resolution across the network. the database is updated via the zone transfer process.
	5. Active Directory Integrated
		Zone information held in the windows Active Directory and replicated using Active Directory replication, providing greater flexibikity in the replication process. File name is ntds.dit. 2 active direcory and 2 primary dns. both rea write update
	6. Stub Zone
		Contains only the resource records needed to identify the authoritative DNS servers for the zone.

DNS round robin:
	one A record with 2 IP address.

DNS Netmask Ordering:
	If some A records with same name but with different IP address are in DNS the DNS return the answer to the client based on the range of client's IP. The problem is with classless IP addresses.


DNS zone transfer:
	1. Secondary DNS ask a SOA Query for zone from Primary DNS
	2. Master replied SOA record number. SOA query answer. (Zone Status)
	3. Secondary ask IXFR or AXFR query for zone
		AXFR query: Full copy of primary zone
		IXFR query: incremental copy of zone (Just update)
	4. Primary replied IXFR or AXFR to Secondary. (zone transfer)

DNS port 53 UDP is for DNS to clients
DNS port 53 TCP is for DNS to DNS

Active Directory DNS Zone Replication Scope:
	1. Forest
	2. Domain
	3. Windows 2000 Compatibility
	4. Directory Partition
