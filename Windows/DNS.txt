DNS Deligation: DNS delegation is the process by which a parent DNS zone indicates to DNS resolvers that it has delegated the authority for a DNS subzone (or child zone) to a different set of DNS servers. This allows the DNS resolvers to locate and query the delegated DNS servers for the subzone's DNS records.
